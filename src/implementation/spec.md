# Spec

## Requirements

Things that the array spec must have

- Shape
  - Cardinality: exact, ranges, unbounded
  - Dimensionality: exact, ranges, unbounded
- Dtype
  - LinkML type system
- Annotations
- Referencing

## Constraints

Things that bound the possible ways of meeting the requirements

- Authoring - how easy is it to write?
- Implementation Difficulty - how easy is it to implement?
- Surprisingness - how often does unexpected behavior occur?
- Implementation Universality - how many frameworks can express it?
- Expressiveness - how much can it represent?
- Implementation Agnosticism - how dependent on a particular array framework is it?
